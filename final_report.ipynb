    "# Predicting Churn at Telco\n",
    "\n",

    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Objectives\n",
    "- The goal of this project is to find drivers of churn at Telco and answer the question: \"Why are customers churning? \n",
    "- Construct a Machine Learning classification model that can accurately predict customer churn.\n",
    "- Deliver a report that clearly lays out findings and insights, and summarizes the process taken to reach them.\n",
    "- Present recommendations to stakeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Telco, a large telecommunications company, is churning customers at a rate of about 26% percent. They want to find out why customers are churning and what changes they can make to reduce customer churn in the future. The minimum viable product is a machine learning model that can accurately predict customer churn at a rate above the baseline and can be used to make recommendations for potential changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Initial Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Is there a service type more associated with churn than expected?\n",
    "- Is a certain payment or contract type associated with higher churn?\n",
    "- Do customers who churn have higher average monthly charges?\n",
    "- Do monthly charges increase with tenure? How does this affect churn?\n"
